        <h5> Scope of our privacy notice</h5>
        <p>This notice applies to anyone who interacts with us in relation to our products and services (“you”, “your”), via any channel (e.g. app, website, email, phone, walk-ins to OYO-branded accommodations, booking an OYO-branded accommodation via a
            third party travel agency, etc.). We may give you additional privacy notices if required for specific interactions.</p>
        <p>If you book a stay through us at one of our partners’ guest houses, hotels and other lodgings (i.e. you stay at a property that is not OYO-branded), that partner will use your personal data as shown in their privacy notice.</p>
        <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample">
            <div>
                <p>This privacy notice applies to individuals who enquire about, purchase or make use of our products and services, such as when a user signs up with OYO, modifies her account, makes a booking (whether through our app, website, in person
                    or via any other channel), requests on-demand services, contacts customer support, stays at OYO-branded accommodations or otherwise communicates or interacts with OYO.</p>
                <p>It describes how we handle your information, regardless of the way you contact us (e.g. app, website, email, phone, walk-ins to OYO-branded accommodations, etc.). Sometimes we will provide you with additional information or notices, depending
                    on the way we interact with each other, e.g. if you use particular functionality on our app, we may explain how that functionality uses your information.</p>
                <p>OYO offers accommodation in both OYO-branded guest houses, hotels and other lodgings. The word “OYO” appears in front of all OYO-branded accommodations, e.g. OYO 116 Kathmandu Resort, OYO 316 Hotel Brigade Royale and OYO 2262 Hotel Heritage
                    Inn. If you book a stay through us at one of our partners’ accommodations, that partner will use your personal information as shown in their privacy notice (which can normally be found on our partner’s website or is provided by our
                    partner via email or at check-in).</p>
